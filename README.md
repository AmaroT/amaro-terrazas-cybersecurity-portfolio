# Amaro Terrazas - Cybersecurity Portfolio

U.S. Marine Corps Veteran (Sergeant) | B.S. Computer Science (Expected May 2026, 3.8 GPA) | Transitioning to Cybersecurity from Application Development

This repository serves as my growing cybersecurity portfolio.  
I am currently building hands-on experience through self-study labs, coursework, and personal projects while preparing for CompTIA Security+ (expected Spring 2026).  
My goal is to document practical exposure to defensive security concepts, secure development practices, and foundational tools — with a focus on enterprise-relevant skills like zero-trust principles, OS hardening, cloud security basics, and automation scripting.

## About Me
- **Background**: 4+ years as Application Developer Associate at Accenture (Java, Spring Boot, AWS integrations, secure coding practices, Agile/DevSecOps workflows).  
- **Military Experience**: Sergeant (MOS 5979), Tactical Air Operations Module Technician — managed cryptographic networks, secure communications, and mission-critical systems with 99.9% uptime in high-stakes environments
- **Current Focus**: Bridging secure software development experience into full cybersecurity engineering roles.  
- **Certifications in Progress/Completed**:
  - CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) – In Progress (Expected Spring 2026)
  - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
  - Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) & AI Fundamentals (AI-900)
  - Full-Stack Web Development (Codeup, 2020)

## Skills Exposure & Learning Areas
- Cybersecurity Frameworks: NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK, zero-trust principles, privileged access (Just-In-Time concepts), basic threat modeling  
- Tools & Labs: Kali Linux, nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, TryHackMe / HackTheBox rooms  
- Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2, Security Groups), Azure Fundamentals  
- Development & Automation: Java/Spring Boot (secure coding), Python scripting basics, PowerShell familiarity, CI/CD exposure (Jenkins)  
- OS & Endpoint: Introductory Windows/Linux hardening concepts  
- Other: Agile/Scrum, Git, secure SDLC practices

## Projects & Portfolio Highlights

This repo documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning and projects. Below are key areas with current examples (more added regularly).

- **TryHackMe / HackTheBox Labs**  
  Detailed write-ups including tools used (nmap, Wireshark), step-by-step commands, vulnerability findings, and key takeaways from beginner-to-intermediate rooms (e.g., network enumeration, web exploitation basics).  
  → See /writeups/ for full reports and screenshots.

- **Home Lab: Kali Linux & Hardening**  
  Guides for setting up a secure personal lab environment, including network segmentation, basic firewall rules, and OS hardening techniques (inspired by CIS benchmarks).  
  → Check /docs/homelab-setup.md for configuration steps and before/after examples.

- **Secure Coding Snippets**  
  Java/Spring Boot examples applying secure development principles (authentication with JWT, input sanitization, encryption basics) from CS-305 coursework.  
  → Code and explanations in /secure-coding/.

- **Automation & Scripting**  
  Basic Python and PowerShell scripts for common security tasks (e.g., simple port scanner wrapper, log file parser for anomaly detection).  
  → Scripts available in /scripts/ with usage instructions.

- **Threat Modeling & Framework Applications**  
  Short analyses applying MITRE ATT&CK tactics and NIST CSF controls to lab scenarios or hypothetical applications.  
  → Examples in /threat-modeling/.
